  <h1>Kevin McCarthy</h1>
  <p><em>Full Stack Web Developer and Sales Engineer</em></p>
  <br>
  <p>After a successful sales career, I found that I had tired of only being involved in the
    initial steps of the process, so I enrolled in <em>Launch Academy's</em> Full Stack Web Development
    Boot Camp so that I could develop the subject matter expertise needed to better serve client
    needs.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Prior to studying at <em>Launch Academy</em>, I was a <strong>Business Development Executive</strong>
    for a number of consulting firms including <em>Grant Thornton</em> and <em>UHY Advisors</em>. </p>
